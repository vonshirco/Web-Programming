Validation

Validation is commonly defined as the process of checking the values inputted by the user. 
It plays an important role in web applications and enhances the overall user experience. 
We can validate email, password, date, mobile numbers, and many other fields.

JavaScript is used to validate the form data on the client-side of a web application, and this 
speeds up the validation process because of faster data processing when compared with 
server-side validation.

Email Validation in JavaScript

Email validation in JavaScript is an important part of the user experience of a web application.
Validation assists in inputting forms and makes sure that only valid information is passed to 
the server from the client-side of the application.

Email validation is a critical part of validating an HTML form. An email is a string or a 
subset of ASCII characters separated into two parts by @ symbol. The first part contains 
personal information while the other contains the domain name at which the email is registered.

The personal information part can contain the following ASCII characters:
- Uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z and a-z)
- Numeric characters (0-9)
- Special characters - ! # $ % & ' * + - / = ? ^ _ ` { | } ~
- Period, dot, or full stop (.) with the condition that it cannot be the first or last letter 
of the email and cannot repeat one after another.

The domain name contains:
- Letters
- Digits
- Hyphens
- Dots

One of the most popular ways of validating email in JavaScript is by using regular expressions.
JavaScript uses regular expressions to describe a pattern of characters.
